## Introduction
How good do you and your peers know Switzerland's most famous landscapes? Would you be able to show your knowledge and win against your friends? Gwüsst is an exciting game that allows players to compete against each other in guessing a certain location from Switzerland's most famous landscapes, such as mountains or hills. This is the back-end component of our project. The front-end component can be found [here](https://github.com/sopra-fs24-group-46/server).

## Technologies
The front-end components of this project were written in TSX and JS, using scss as well for styling. Moreover, the React framework is used. Persistence is managed through JPA/Hibernate. Communication between the server and client is achieved through REST.
